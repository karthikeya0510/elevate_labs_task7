# Task 7 - GitHub Users Fetch Project

Hi there! 👋

This is my submission for Task 7 of the Web Development Internship. The task was to fetch data from a **real public API** using JavaScript’s `fetch()` method, and display that data nicely on a webpage.

## 🛠️ What I Did

- Used the **GitHub Users API** (`https://api.github.com/users`) to get a list of real users.
- Fetched the data using the **Fetch API** with `async/await`.
- Displayed each user’s **username**, **profile picture**, and **GitHub link** on the webpage.
- Handled any errors that might occur (like no internet).
- Added a **"Reload Data"** button so the data can be fetched again without refreshing the page.
- Styled the page using **CSS** to make it clean and user-friendly.
